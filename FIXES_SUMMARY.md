# Fixes Applied - DS Venturists

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Categories Section Image Layout
**Problem**: Images in the categories section didn't look good with the current placement
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced category image styling with hover effects and better shadows
- Added gradient overlays and smooth transitions
- Improved category item layout with better proportions (1fr 1.5fr grid)
- Added glassmorphism effect to category containers
- Increased image height from 250px to 300px
- Added hover animations (translateY, scale, box-shadow)

### 2. Team Hierarchy Display Issue
**Problem**: Only the first team member was visible when clicking on team leaders
**Solution**:
- Fixed case-sensitive filename issue: `natasha.png` → `Natasha.png`
- Corrected team member image references in main.ts
- Verified team popup CSS grid layout is working correctly
- Grid uses `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))`

## Files Modified

1. **src/main.ts**
   - Fixed Natasha's image filename (case sensitivity)
   - Verified team data structure

2. **src/styles/main.scss**
   - Enhanced `.category-image` styling
