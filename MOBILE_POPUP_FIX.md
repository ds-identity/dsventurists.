# Mobile Team Popup Scrolling Fix - DS Venturists

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: On mobile devices, users cannot scroll to see all team members in the team popup - only the first member is visible.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by several CSS layout problems in the team popup on mobile:

1. **Vertical Centering**: The popup used `align-items: center` which could cause content to overflow
2. **Insufficient Padding**: Not enough bottom margin/padding for scrolling
3. **Height Constraints**: Popup content wasn't properly sized for mobile viewports
4. **Touch Scrolling**: Missing iOS smooth scrolling support

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Popup Layout Improvements**
- Changed popup alignment from `center` to `flex-start` on mobile
- Added proper viewport height handling with `height: 100vh`
- Enhanced popup content styling with glassmorphism effects

### 2. **Mobile-Specific Responsive Design**
```scss
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .team-popup {
        padding: 0.5rem;
        align-items: stretch !important;
        justify-content: flex-start !important;
        height: 100vh;
        min-height: 100vh;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Improved Scrolling**
- Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for iOS smooth scrolling
- Added bottom margin to popup content for proper scrolling space
- Changed close button to `position: fixed` for better accessibility

### 4. **Enhanced Mobile UX**
- Reduced padding on smaller screens (480px and below)
- Improved touch targets for close button
- Better spacing for team member cards

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
- **src/styles/main.scss** - Enhanced popup responsive design

### Key CSS Updates:
1. **Main Popup Container**:
   - Added touch scrolling support
   - Fixed viewport height handling

2. **Mobile Responsiveness** (768px and below):
   - Removed vertical centering
   - Added proper bottom spacing
   - Fixed close button positioning

3. **Small Mobile** (480px and below):
   - Reduced padding and margins
   - Optimized for smaller screens

## Result
✅ **Fixed**: Users can now scroll through all team members on mobile devices
✅ **Enhanced**: Smooth touch scrolling on iOS devices  
✅ **Improved**: Better responsive design across all mobile screen sizes
✅ **Maintained**: Desktop functionality remains unchanged

## Testing Instructions
1. Open the site on mobile (or use browser dev tools mobile view)
2. Navigate to Team section
3. Click on any team leader (e.g., "Head of PR")
4. Verify you can scroll to see all team members
5. Test close button functionality
6. Test on different mobile screen sizes

The popup should now display all team members with proper scrolling capability on mobile devices.
